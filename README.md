# Evolutionary Computing Optimization

**Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing**  
**University of Zagreb**

This repository contains four laboratory exercises developed as part of the **Evolutionary Computing Optimization** course at the **Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb**.

Each folder (`lab1`, `lab2`, `lab3`, and `lab4`) includes a PDF file describing the task and implementation details for that particular lab.

## Contents

### Lab 1
